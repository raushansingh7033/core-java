interface is a collection of abstract methods. it is similar to a class but differs in that it doesn't  have any implementation for its methods . all methods decalred in an interface implicitly public , abstract and without body .
additionally interface can contains constants , default methods and static methods . there can be only abstract methods in java interface , not method body

it can have only abstract methods and static fields.
since java 8 interface can have default and static methods and from jva 9 it can have private methods as well


Advantage of interface
it support multiple inheritance
it helps to achieve abstraction
it can have used to achieve loose coupling

interface interafce_name{
  // fields
  // abstract / private / default methods
}


interface keypoints
method inside interface must not be static,final,native or strictfp
all variables declared inside interface are implicitly public static and final
all methods declared inside interface are implicitly public and abstract even you don't use public or abstract keyword
interface can extend one or more other interface
interface can not implement a class
interface can be nested inside another interface
