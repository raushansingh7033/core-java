OOps stands for object oriented programming system which is a methodology to develop and design the programming using class and object 

//Advantage

encapsulation
abstraction

// class
a class is a blueprint or template or modal for creating objects 
it defines the structure and behavior of objects that will be instantiated from it

// rules
a class can have only public and default (no modifier) access specifier
it can be either abstract final or normal class
it must have the class keyword
it may optionally extend only one parent class. by Default , it extend object class

syntax
class class_name{
  field
  constructor
  method
}

// object
an object is a real world entity some real objects are ball fan car etc 
an object represents the class and the consists of properties and behavior  

// syntax
className variable_name=new ClassName()
 example


// method 
method is similar to a function defined in other programming languages.
method describes behavior of an object. a method is collection of statements that are grouped together to perform operation.

syntax 
return-type methodName(arg1,arg2....argn)
{
  // body of method
}

// example 
// wap to create using 


// constructor
a constructor is a special type of method is used to initialize objects of a class. constructor are called when an object of class is created

// some key points
constructor name : a constructor has the name as the class name
no-return type: constructors do not have return type not even void
they are automatically called when an object of class is created and do not return any value.

// type
default constructor
No-argument constructor
Parametrized constructor
constructor overloading
copy constructor
private constructor 

// A default constructor is automatically provided by the java compiler when no other constructor are defined within the class. it also sometime called a no argument constructor because it takes no arguments or parameters


 // no argument constructor
 no argument constructor is constructor in a class takes no parameters
 class

 // parametrized constructor
  A parametrized constructor is constructor that takes one or more parameters when creating instance of a class 

  // constructor overloading
  constructor overloading is technique or having more than constructor with different parameter in same class


  // copy constructor
  copy constructor create new object by using value of existing object
  copy constructor are not not built into the java languages like they are in some other languages like c++, but you can create your own custom copy constructor by providing a constructor that takes an instances of the same class as a parameter 

// private constructor
a private constructor is constructor declared with private access modifier
this means the constructor can only be accessed within the same class and cannot be used by other class
