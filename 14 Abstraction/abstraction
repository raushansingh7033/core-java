Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features to the user, focusing on what the object does rather than how it does it.

there are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
Abstract class(0 to 100%)
Interface(100%)

abstract class
a class which is declared using abstract keyword known as abstract class
an abstract class may or may not have abstract methods. we cannot create object of abstract class

it is used to achieve abstraction but it does not provide 100% abstraction beacause it can have concrete methods

it is used to achieve abstraction but it does not provide 100% abstraction because it can have concrete methods

abstraction class provides partial abstraction and interface provides complete abstraction

- an abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword
- an abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation
- an abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods some of them can concrete methods

- a method-defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory or making the subclass itself abstract.
- any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract keyword.
- there can be no objects of an abstract class. that is , an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator.
- an abstract class can have parameterized constructors and the default constructor is always present in an abstract class

abstract method
a method that are decalred without any body within an abstract class are called abstract method . the method body will be defined by its subclass
abstract method can never be final and static
