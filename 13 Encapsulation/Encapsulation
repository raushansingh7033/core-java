Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers and getter / setter methods

Encapsulation is an OOP concept that wraps data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access to the data using access modifiers, providing data security and controlled access

Encapsulation → Hides data

Abstraction → Hides implementation

encapsulation in java can be achieved by

1. Declaring the variables of a class as private
2. providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables
